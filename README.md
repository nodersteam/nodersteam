## Community Engagement

We maintain a technically proficient community on Telegram, consisting of 2000+ blockchain enthusiasts. Our present DAO of Influence includes opinion leaders from regions such as Indonesia, the CIS countries, Australia, and Italy, with a total subscriber count exceeding 500,000.

## Our Journey

Over the past two years, we have transitioned from validating various blockchain projects and managing nodes to striving to provide top-tier validator services. To achieve this, we utilize the best available equipment scattered worldwide, a unique self-developing monitoring system operating 24/7, and advanced cybersecurity practices.

## Infrastructure

Our nodes (including all test networks) are hosted only on trusted providers - Amazon, Google, Oracle, Vultr, and Hetzner. We also use our own facilities located in Austria, Greece, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan.

## Experience

We have participated in more than 100+ test networks and are currently validating several mainnets.
